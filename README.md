Minuit is a Visual Studio Code theme inspired by [Dan Abramov's Overreacted blog](https://overreacted.io/) color scheme, which was itself based on [Sarah Drasner's Night Owl](https://github.com/sdras/night-owl-vscode-theme/) syntax theme. It comes in two variants: Minuit and Minuit Soft (with lowered contrast).
